Implemented a flexible Progress component with accessibility in mind. The new implementation includes ProgressRoot, ProgressIndicator, ProgressTrack, ProgressLabel, and ProgressValue, ensuring WCAG compliance with ARIA attributes. An alternative aria-live implementation for dynamic status announcements (WCAG 4.1.3) has been explored but is not yet finalized. Initial testing was conducted with unit tests, Chrome, and VoiceOver.
